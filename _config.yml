  I'm an undergraduate student at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology studying [Telecom Engineering](https://teleng.knust.edu.gh/) in the [Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://coe.knust.edu.gh/faculties/faculty-electrical-computer-engineering). I am deeply interested in conducting research and building projects within the fields of Applied Machine Learning and Quantitative Finance. Currently, I work on developing smart, real-world applications using machine learning techniques that are unique to each problem, reflecting both knowledge and action under the mentorship of [Dr. Francisca Adoma Acheampong](https://webapps.knust.edu.gh/staff/dirsearch/profile/summary/fb34c7d09958.html). I also have experience in mathematical modeling for applications in predicting market capitalization and identifying arbitrage betting opportunities [See My ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Benjamin-Attabra/research).

            **Benjamin Ekow Attabra** (2023). [Market Capitalization Forecasting with Annuity Due Models](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387671507_Market_Capitalization_Forecasting_with_Annuity_Due_Models). This paper presents a mathematical model for estimating the future market capitalization of public companies by adapting the future value of annuity due formula. Our findings suggest that this modified annuity due model can serve as a valuable tool for investors and analysts in making informed forecasts about company valuations.

            **Benjamin Ekow Attabra** (2023). [Mathematical Analysis of Multi-Outcome Sports Betting Arbitrage: A System of Equations Approach](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387671984_Mathematical_Analysis_of_Multi-Outcome_Sports_Betting_Arbitrage_A_System_of_Equations_Approach). This paper introduces a mathematical framework for identifying arbitrage opportunities in three-outcome sports betting markets. By utilizing systems of simultaneous equations, we develop a method for optimal stake allocation across bookmakers.
